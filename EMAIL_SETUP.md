# PayFlow Email Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up email functionality in PayFlow using Resend.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get Resend API Key
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create a new API key in your dashboard
3. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Email Provider (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key_here"
EMAIL_FROM="PayFlow <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

# Required for email links
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # or your production URL
```

### 3. Domain Setup (Production)
For production, you'll need to:
1. Add and verify your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Update `EMAIL_FROM` to use your verified domain
3. Set up DNS records as instructed by Resend

## Email Templates

PayFlow includes three professional email templates:

### üìß Signature Request Email
- Sent when documents are created with `sendImmediately: true`
- Includes document title, sender name, and signing link
- Shows expiration date if set

### ‚è∞ Signature Reminder Email
- Sent when using "Resend" functionality in dashboard
- Smart urgency levels based on expiration
- Shows days pending

### ‚úÖ Document Completed Email
- Sent when all signatures are collected
- Lists all signers and completion details
- Includes download link

## Testing Email Functionality

### Check Email Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-email
```

### Send Test Emails
```bash
# Test signature request email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "signature-request",
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "recipientName": "John Doe",
    "documentTitle": "Service Agreement",
    "senderName": "Jane Smith"
  }'

# Test reminder email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "signature-reminder",
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "recipientName": "John Doe",
    "documentTitle": "Service Agreement",
    "senderName": "Jane Smith",
    "daysPending": 5
  }'

# Test completion email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "document-completed",
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "recipientName": "Jane Smith",
    "documentTitle": "Service Agreement",
    "totalSignatures": 2
  }'
```

## Email Workflows

### Document Creation & Sending
1. User creates document with recipients
2. If `sendImmediately: true`, signature request emails are sent
3. Each recipient gets a personalized email with signing link

### Signature Completion
1. When someone signs a document
2. System checks if all signatures are collected
3. If complete, document owner gets completion notification

### Reminders & Follow-ups
1. Use "Resend" button in dashboard for individual reminders
2. Use bulk resend for multiple pending signatures
3. Smart urgency based on expiration dates

## Email Configuration Options

### Sender Configuration
```typescript
// Default sender (from EMAIL_FROM env var)
"PayFlow <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

// Custom sender per email
await sendEmail({
  from: "Custom Name <custom@yourdomain.com>",
  // ... other options
});
```

### Error Handling
PayFlow uses `sendEmailSafe()` for graceful error handling:
- Logs errors without breaking app functionality
- Returns success/failure status
- Continues workflow even if email fails

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Emails work with Resend's test domain
- **Production**: Requires verified domain for better deliverability
- **Testing**: Use `/api/test-email` endpoint for validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"RESEND_API_KEY environment variable is not set"**
- Make sure `.env.local` contains your Resend API key
- Restart your development server after adding env vars

**"Failed to send email: Domain not found"**
- For production, verify your domain in Resend dashboard
- For development, you can use Resend's test domain

**Email not received**
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify recipient email address
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Debugging
1. Check email status: `GET /api/test-email`
2. Send test email: `POST /api/test-email`
3. Check server logs for email errors
4. Verify environment variables are loaded

## Advanced Features

### Custom Email Templates
Email templates are React components in `src/emails/`:
- `signature-request.tsx`
- `signature-reminder.tsx`  
- `document-completed.tsx`

### Bulk Operations
The signature router supports bulk email sending for:
- Multiple reminder emails
- Batch signature requests
- Document notifications

### Email Preferences (Future)
Framework is in place for user email preferences:
- Notification types
- Frequency settings
- Opt-out options

## Security & Privacy

- Emails include unsubscribe information
- Signature links are secure and time-limited
- No sensitive document content in emails
- GDPR-friendly sender information
